Its bank database exists in sheets needed to upload into dwh with some schema and then extract some measures using dax after we connect the ssms with powerbi 
-My Contributions
Modeling the sheets based on business needs 
Designed the dwh in the ssms to be as the sheet’s schema design and it based on the categories 
then uploaded the data from the sheets to the dwh using ETL tool (ssis) to fill the tables in the dwh by the data from the sheets 
and last connected the power bi to the dwh to transform the data makes measures and dashboard design to share it with the users
